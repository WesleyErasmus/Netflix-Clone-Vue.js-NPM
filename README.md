## General Info

Welcome to the Netflix Clone Application.

Enter your full-name or username and password to log in to the App. Once you've logged in, your username will show in the top navbar.

This Netflix Clone allows you to add and remove movies from your watch-list. View the coming soon movies in the Coming Soon page. Each movie item has show-more button where you can view the movies details and cast. The watch-list movies are persistent, so you won't lose your watch-list after refreshing your browser or even closing your browser. 

The App also helps to prevent duplicate movies from being added to the watch-list.

Use the Back to top button in the navbar to help you navigate your way around the App. There are back buttons on the Coming Soon, Watch-list, and Search pages to help you easily navigate back to the home page.

The coming soon movies are easily identifiable by their banners. You will be able to add these movies to the watch-list once they are available to watch.

Click on the search bar icon to search through the movie catalogue. View the movie selection on your Desktop, Tablet, and mobile phone as this App is fully responsive.

There is a dedicated page for your watch-listed movies. Click on the "Clear watch list" button to remove all the movies in your list.
